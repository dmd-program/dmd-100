# Open Design Project

## Brief

In this project, you will design a kit of parts that can be used to build a toy, model, or other object. This object will be a collection or kit of parts that can be reconfigured to create variations. This is serious \(though playful\) product design. There are two ways to approach this project. You can decide to create your own parts, create custom parts from raw materials like cardboard, wood, foam, and others. Or, you could develop creative ways of using commonly found objects like rubber bands, toothpicks, paper clips, etc. Your kit should include parts allowing someone to assemble variations. The primary goal of this project is to develop a kit using commonly available resources for others to assemble. A secondary goal is to try to strike a balance between ease of assembly and level of user contribution, now commonly known as the IKEA effect.

### Background

According to the most [recent and comprehensive data](http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/poverty-and-shared-prosperity), 10.7% of the world's population lives in poverty, so the easier and cheaper it is for others to create or obtain your parts, the more accessible your project will be.

Originally conceived by the Institute Without Boundaries, the [Open Structures project](http://beta.openstructures.net/pages/9) has defined design guidelines to aid the users of the design framework: (1) Design for disassembly, (2) Design with recyclable materials, (3) Design from the OS grid. They are concerned that the objects can be taken apart once built, that they don't harm the environment if discarded, and that anything designed with the system will be interoperable.

## Requirements:

1. Parts should be simple \(avoid parts that are difficult to construct or provide instructions for constructing\).
2. A kit should have more than one part \(parts may be the same\).
3. Materials should not cost more than $10.

There are many examples of modular toys and kits in stores and on the Internet. If you decide to take direct inspiration and remix other works and ideas, you must ensure that there is a good balance between copying, transforming, and combining. There must be some novelty in your work, and it should be obvious that this project came from you.
