# Define: Product pitch

Now will choose a product that will form the basis for the project. To do this, you will highlight an existing toy product and produce a one-sentence pitch to explain how you might alter or make design changes, particularly if you find aspects of the product problematic ecologically, culturally, etc.

## Product pitch document

Create a `.doc` file with the following:

1. Name
2. Date
3. Title
4. Current Toy Profile
   1. Toy name or type (choose one)
      * Human or animal figures
      * Architectural models
      * Machines
      * Structures and shapes
      * Puzzle or game
      * Integrated electronics
      * other
   2. Describe the basic function or essence of the toy.
   3. Who is the toy designed for?
   4. What does it do? How does it work?
   5. What materials is it made of?
   6. How much does it cost?
5. The Pitch
   1. I will design a(n) **\(toy name\)** for **\(target user\).** The key changes include **(list key changes)**.
      * An example pitch might be, **"I will design a finger puppet game for older children. Key changes to finger puppets include a way to allow a child to alter the face of the puppet and the incorporation of game rules that foster conversational skills."**
      * Note: This pitch will guide the direction for the rest of the project.
