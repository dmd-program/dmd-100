# InvisionApp Tutorials

These are quick tutorials to help explain the process of setting up and distributing InvisionApp prototypes as well as submitting to box.psu.edu and ELMSLN Studio.

## Prepare images for upload

If you are working from photos that are not the correct size and aspect ratio, you will need to crop them to prepare them for upload.

There are free image cropping tools included with Mac and Windows operating systems: 

* [Windows](http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/56624/how-to-rotate-crop-photos-in-windows-10/)
* [Mac OS](http://osxdaily.com/2014/06/16/crop-image-mac-preview/)

To keep organized, it helps to number your files. If you forgot an image and include it after the fact, you can use a decimal instead of renaming all of the files.

## Set up a new iPhone project

1. Create a Prototype Project
2. Select an iPhone template
3. Upload your cropped images.

## Share prototype link

1. On the project view, click on the big green share link on the top left.
2. Click on the public share link to copy it to your clipboard. \(This sets your computer so the next time you perform a paste command, it will paste the link\)

## Submit link to the Studio

1. Navigate to [ELMSLN Studio](/h ttps://studio.aanda.psu.edu/dmd100/cle/app/projects)
2. Click on the related project assignment
   3.Paste the public link URL to your prototype into the submission text box.
3. If you have made changes to the prototype \(typically if this is the second or third iteration\), be sure to add a log of changes that you've made to the prototype based on feedback before submitting. This will help us know what was changed.
