# Pathway design activity

A **_pathway_** describes a literal or metaphorical route or series of events connecting a current condition to a future condition. In biochemistry, metabolic pathways describe sequences of chemical reactions that occur in living organisms. In physiology, neural pathways describe chains of cells that carry signals connecting one part of the nervous system to another. And in the context of education, a _learning pathway_ describes the sequence and range of knowledge a learner acquires over a duration of time.

In this activity, you will consider the pathways that might help you reach a kind of goal

Your pathway will consist of a few key elements:

1. Trajectory
  - Where do you want to go? 
2. Behavioral patterns
  - What behavior loops can you identify?
  - What will keep you on track and motivated?
  - What behaviors are worth repeating? What are worth altering?
3. Resources
  - What will you need to get you where you are going?
  - What creative and productivity tools will you need?
4. Timeline
  - What are the time constraints?
  - When do you need to repeat?
