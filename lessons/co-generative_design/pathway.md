# Pathway design activity

A **_pathway_** describes a literal or metaphorical route or series of events connecting a current condition to a future condition. In biochemistry, metabolic pathways describe sequences of chemical reactions that occur in living organisms. In physiology, neural pathways describe chains of cells that carry signals connecting one part of the nervous system to another. And in the context of education, a _learning pathway_ describes the sequence and range of knowledge a learner acquires over a duration of time.

In this activity, you will consider the pathways that might help you reach a goal. This can breaking into a new career, mastery of a skill or field of inquiry, production of a body of work, or the pursuit of a cause.

## Part 1: Developing a strategy

1. **Setting a trajectory**
  - Where do you want to go? 
2. **Domain knowledge**
  - What knowledge or skills do you already know that you don't know?
  - How will you discover what knowledge and skills you didn't know you needed to know? 
  - What experiences do you need to help you grow?
2. **Behavioral patterns**
  - Can you identify behaviors that propel you along your trajectory?
  - Can you identify behaviors that hold you back. (mental attitudes, beliefs, actions, and activities)
  - How might you eliminate or alter behaviors that work against your goals?
  - What new behaviors might you employ?
3. **Resources**
  - What tools will you need to further your creative practice?
  - What steps are you taking to procure these tools?
4. **People**
  - Who encourages and supports your trajectory?
  - Who tries to hold you back or is negative? 
  - Can you identify communities of practice locally or virtually?
  - Who can you ask for help, motivation, or advice?
5. **Events**
  - What events, conversations, or interactions need to take place? When?
  - What are the looming obstacles or unknowns?
  - When would it be time to alter your trajectory?
  
## Part 2 - Deploy

1. Mission statement
2. Your Code of Conduct
3. Mapping your path
 - Timeline of events
 - Expected results
4. Accountability
  - What or who will hold you accountable? Will you include a reward or disciplinary system?
  
## Requirements:

- Document standards
  - Format: `.doc`
- Trajectory complexity:
  - It should take a few months to a few years.
