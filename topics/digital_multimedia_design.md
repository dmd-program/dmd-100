# Digital Multimedia Design

In the first DMD course, DMD 100, you will get a broad sense of what design is, and how you can apply it as frame for your studies. You will then explore other courses available to you within the approved major list as well as elective courses. In DMD 300, you will apply your experiences from this coursework to narrow your focus and interests while producing projects in collaboration with your peers. DMD 400 is the capstone course, where you will create an entirely self-directed design project for inclusion in an online exhibition of work.

Design is now a relevant force in science, art, business, technology, humanities, and other traditionally silo'd fields, and this means that deciding what and how to teach a designer, particularly in a multi-domain program, becomes a rather daunting feat of pedagogical alchemy. It is this reason that you have been asked to read a book that talks about design from a philosophical and social perspective. As you move through your academic studies, you can and should deep dive into aspects of design that you find exciting and fulfilling. In this degree program, you will examine design as it relates to digital tools and skills needed for story telling, products and artifacts, interaction and experiences, and the production and dissemination of knowledge.

## Mission

The Digital Multimedia Design Program promotes the value of imagination and creativity as human resources. Digital media generally refers to the storage and transmission of information in increasingly varied multimedia digital formats and devices, and within a changing array of modes of communication. Design is a means by which we respond to change in a purposeful way. By focusing on issues and opportunities, designers develop plans for taking innovative and strategic actions. Hence digital design shapes and impacts the physical and virtual spaces people inhabit. Over the course of this program, you will produce projects that stimulate sound habits of mind, develop proficiencies of practice, and foster critical sensibilities for addressing issues.

## DMD Core

The program is made of three spine courses and six required courses – two from each contributing college; Information Sciences & Technology, Communications, and Arts & Architecture. The core courses will provide skills and context pertinent to the disciplines from which they reside. The spine courses provide opportunities to frame and combine experiences from these disciplines.

## Pathways

Though design is part of the core identity of the program, each student will develop their own pathway forward. There are recommendations for pathways on the DMD Program Hub to help you get started.

## Projects

Over time, you will develop capabilities necessary to use digital technologies in multimedia projects. DMD 100 projects are designed for students with limited knowledge of digital production technology, but introduces foundational design knowledge that can be applied to frame all future DMD coursework. Final projects in the capstone course will be made available as part of an online exhibition.

## Portfolios

Developing a creative digital portfolio of work that showcases your interest areas and capabilities will become an essential component for professional development.
